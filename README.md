Gradientology is a transdisciplinary framework that explores relationality, systemic gradients, and derivational ontologies. It integrates concepts from philosophy, systems theory, and ethics to provide a novel lens for understanding complex interactions in natural and social systems. This repository serves as a central hub for foundational documents, theoretical treatises, and supporting materials related to Gradientology.
